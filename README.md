# Fleck_Student_Portal_System
Fully Responsive and Animated and with full of functionality with admin, teacher, student portal

Introduction:
The project focuses on designing and implementing a robust Student Academic Portal System 
using Node.js, React, HTML, and CSS. This system aims to revolutionize traditional university 
administrative processes by offering a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for students and 
instructors.
The Flecks project is an exciting initiative with a simple yet powerful goal: to enhance the 
academic experience for students, teachers, and University or School staff. This project is all about 
creating a user-friendly website that functions similarly to the popular Flex platform, making it easy for 
everyone involved.
The primary functionalities of the website encompass course management, tracking academic 
performance, and ensuring robust data security. Serving as a centralized platform, it enables students to 
self-register for courses and view their academic progress, eliminating the need to approach individual 
instructors for grade inquiries. Additionally, students can access their transcripts, and personal 
information is securely stored in the database, accessible to teachers and administration. For teachers, 
the system facilitates the straightforward addition of student grades and attendance by locating their roll 
numbers. Furthermore, administrators have the capability to insert data for both students and teachers.
This integration of services into a single, user-friendly location enhances the convenience and efficiency of 
the education process, allowing students to easily check their marks and attendance in each subject.
The primary objective of the Flecks project is to simplify academic management. For students, it means 
an easier path to check their progress in studies. University or School staff benefit from streamlined 
operations, making their tasks more efficient. Overall, Flecks aims to bring flexibility, teamwork, and 
ultimately make it a better experience for everyone involved.
